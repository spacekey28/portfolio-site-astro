**Define your project**

- Start by defining the goal of your project. This can be showing your portfolio to the world, selling an e-book, building a blog, etc.
- Also, define your audience. Ask yourself: which is the typical user that will visit my website?
<br><br>

**Plan out everything**

- Once your project is defined, plan your content carefully. This includes text, images, videos, icons, etc.
- Brainstorm with visual hierarchy. Always focus on the mobile-first approach. Design for the content first, not the container.
- Define navigation.
- Define the site structure. You can draw a sitemap in this step if we're talking about a bigger project.
<br><br>

**Sketch your ideas**

- Get the ideas out of your head: sketch before you design. It helps explore options and clarify the concept. Pencil and paper are great for quickly capturing ideas.
- Make as many sketches as you want, but don't perfect them. Once you have a direction, refine details during design with markup/template/style languages.
<br><br>

**Design and develop your website**

- After sketching, start to design your website using the guidelines and tips you've learned.
- Use the right tools and editors. Choosing well saves a lot of time.
- Write clean, reusable code. This habit helps collaborators and future you.

**It's not done yet: optimisation**

- Before launch, optimise performance (e.g., Lighthouse site speed).
- Do basic search engine optimisation (SEO) so your content can be discovered.
