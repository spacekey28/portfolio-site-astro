Gained hands-on experience with MVC frameworks, mobile UI/UX flows, and the full app store publishing process. Built ATM Finder (2013), which extracted live ATM data and displayed locations on MKMapView with branch-based filtering. Developed Payslip (2015), a PAYE calculator using SwipeView for seamless, gesture-driven navigation through to a printable payslip screen. (Apps are no longer available in the store.)
