I turned the approved designs for Mighty Campers into a tidy set of reusable React components in TypeScript, then built a high-performance headless front end with Next.js. It connects to the CMS via GraphQL, so the marketing team can create and update pages quickly without developer handoffsâ€”keeping the site fast, consistent, and easy to grow.
